### Project Overview
---
ZECH bank is a small community bank located in Indian, the bank as engaged our services to help understand the performance of its credit card bussiness line based on its performance in the last three years (2004-2006),
to help the board make decision to sell or keep this bussiness line. In order to visualise the business operations I created a Power BI dashboard.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
In this EDA we would be trying to analyze the data gotten from Kaggle to get an insight into ZECH bank credit facility operations and performance across India. Hence, we would be answering questions like;
1.  What are the credit card products offered by ZECH and which contributes the most to its revenue?
2.	What is ZECH customer base accross the country?
3.	What is the spend and repayment pattern of its customers?
4.	How has the business been performing from 2004 to 205?
5.	Which age group and employment segment contributes the most to revenue?
6.	What is the credit card utization pattern accross the products and country?
 
 Through our understanding of these questions, we hope to give the client insight into the bussiness performace and areas of opportunities within the bussiness.

The business operates four lines of business (printer sale, copier sale, Parts, and Service Plan) across all its stores with the Service plan contributing the bust to revenue year-on-year (see *chart II*). The business operates on all days of the year but 94% of its sales are made during workdays as illustr
