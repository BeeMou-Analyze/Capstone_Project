### Project Overview
---
Bank ZECH is a small community bank located in Indian, the bank as engaged our services to help understand the performance of its credit card bussiness line based on its performance in the last three years (2004-2006),
to help the board make decision to sell or keep this bussiness line. In order to visualise the business operations I created a Power BI dashboard.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
In this EDA we would be trying to analyze the data gotten from Kaggle to get an insight into Bank ZECH India credit facility operations and performance across India. Hence, we would be answering questions like;
1.  What are the credit card products offered by ZECH and which contributes the most to its revenue?
2.	What is Bank ZECH customer base accross the country?
3.	What is the spend and repayment pattern of its customers?
4.	How has the business been performing from 2004 to 205?
5.	Which age group and employment segment contributes the most to revenue?
6.	What is the credit card utization pattern accross the products and country?
 
 Through our understanding of these questions, we hope to give the client insight into the bussiness performace and areas of opportunities within the bussiness.
