### Project Overview
---
Bank ZECH is a small community bank located in Indian, the bank as engaged our services to help understand the performance of its credit card bussiness line based on its performance in the last three years (2004-2006),
to help the board make decision to sell or keep this bussiness line. In order to visualise the business operations I created a Power BI dashboard.

   - Power BI; to depict and visualise the data


### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
In this EDA we would be trying to analyze the data gotten from Kaggle to get an insight into Bank ZECH India credit facility operations and performance across India. Hence, we would be answering questions like;
1.  What are the credit card products offered by ZECH and which contributes the most to its revenue?
2.	What is Bank ZECH customer base accross the country?
3.	What is the spend and repayment pattern of its customers?
4.	How has the business been performing from 2004 to 205?
5.	Which age group and employment segment contributes the most to revenue?
6.	What is the credit card utization pattern accross the products and country?
 
 Through our understanding of these questions, we hope to give the client insight into the bussiness performace and areas of opportunities within the bussiness.


### Data Analysis
---
Through the EDA, I aim to provide insight into the performance of the client's credit card business between 2004 and 2005, identify trends/patterns and make data-driven recommendations to help the board make data-informed decision on its next best course of action.

From the Power BI dashboard analysis made, below are the insights gathered:

**1. Credit Card Operations;** 

Bank ZECH as a credit line business that consist of three major products offerings (Silver, Gold, and Platinum cards). The Gold card holders contribute the most to revenue (as depicted by their spend below) and their spend has increased Y-OY. While the silver card holders have the least spend and they tend to repay earlier. See dashboard summary below.

**2. Customer Base/Spread;** 

Only 100 customers are subscribed to the banks credit facility from 2004 to 2005 and all has been using same card for this period and their usage as increased year-on-year.
The Gold card holders are 38, platinum card holds are 30 while silver card holders are 30. 

The bank credit card holders are majorly in eight cities in India (Bangalore, Bombay, Calcutta, Chennai, Cochin, Delhi, Patna and, Trivandrum). Cochin as the most customers (20), followed by Bangalore (19), while Delhi, Patna and Trivandrum all have the least with just seven customers each. While Cochin as the most customers Bangalore contributes most to revenue (although, it was overtaken by Cochin in 2006 value) while Patna contribute the least (Patna contributed more than Trivandrum in 2004, but Trivandrum revenue leaped in 2005 and 2006).
